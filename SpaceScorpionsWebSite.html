                <h2>Welcome to the Main Page</h2>
                <p>Welcome! This website aims to address the impacts of gender inequality and climate change, focusing on the intersection of these two critical issues. Globally, women and other gender identities are affected by climate change in different ways, creating significant barriers to achieving social justice.</p>
                <p>Gender inequality creates profound disparities in access to resources, decision-making processes, and resilience against the effects of climate change. While women play critical roles in agriculture, water management, and energy sectors, their ability to cope with the climate crisis is severely restricted. This situation hinders not only women's progress but also the sustainable future of entire societies.</p>
                <p>This platform aims to help you understand the connections between gender inequality and climate change while raising awareness on these issues and discussing potential solutions. Here, you can access research, articles, and stories, discovering women's leadership and successes in the fight against climate change. Additionally, you can find information about events and projects discussing how we can work together for gender equality and climate justice, and you can earn the Sustainable Gender Equality Advocate certification.</p>
